No one ever reads the file



I come to develop finally!



Git does include for each commit a full copy of all the files, except that, for the content already present in the Git repo, the snapshot will simply point to said content rather than duplicate it.
That also means that several files with the same content are stored only once.





When we are in a branch, we create a new branch, it just establish based on its usual one.



Why I cannot identify the differences?
